    <p class="text" id="honey-badger-text">(Mellivora capensis), also known as the ratel, is a mammal widely distributed in Africa, Southwest Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. Because of its wide range and occurrence in a variety of habitats, it is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.

      It is the only species in the genus Mellivora and in the mustelid subfamily Mellivorinae. Despite its name, the honey badger does not closely resemble other badger species; instead, it bears more anatomical similarities to weasels. It is primarily a carnivorous species and has few natural predators because of its thick skin, strength and ferocious defensive abilities.</p>

    <p class="text" id="sloth-text">Originally named after one of the Seven Deadly Sins, it’s no surprise that sloths have been labelled as the worlds laziest animals for decades. In fact, when sloths were first described in the scientific literature in 1749 they were labelled as “the lowest form of existence”! Since then, we have learnt that sloths are far from being simple, lazy creatures that just sleep all day. They are complex, mysterious animals that have an evolutionary history so weird that you might accuse us of making it up.</p>

    <p class="text" id="murder-hornet-text">The Asian giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia), including the color form referred to as the Japanese giant hornet, is the world's largest hornet. It is native to temperate and tropical East Asia, South Asia, Mainland Southeast Asia, and parts of the Russian Far East. It was also found in the Pacific Northwest of North America in late 2019,[4] with a few more additional sightings in 2020, prompting concern that it could become an invasive species. They prefer to live in low mountains and forests, while almost completely avoiding plains and high-altitude climates. V. mandarinia creates nests by digging, co-opting pre-existing tunnels dug by rodents, or occupying spaces near rotted pine roots. It feeds primarily on larger insects, colonies of other eusocial insects, tree sap, and honey from honey bee colonies. The hornet has a body length of 45 millimetres (13⁄4 inches), a wingspan around 75 mm (3 in), and a stinger 6 mm (1⁄4 in) long, which injects a large amount of potent venom. Although the scientific literature and official government sources continue to refer to this species by its established common name, the popular media have taken to using the nickname "murder hornet".</p>
